# Implementing a Neural Network to Detect Simulated Gravitational Wave Data

## Description
This deep neural network reads and analyzes data sets with an end goal of identifying a sine wave amidst noise. This sine wave is a model of a real continuous gravitational wave meaning that it is possible for our neural net to use real LIGO data as well as what we generated. We used TensorFlow Keras to build this neural net which has performed well with current testing.  


## Installation and Instructions  
Use:

```bash
git clone -b master git@github.com:shiragg1/icr-cw-dnn.git
```
to clone the repository and access our code. Set the correct path in cw-dnn.py and set the four data files to the file you wish to run.
To download the data files, run:

```bash
chmod +x load-data.sh
```

```bash
./load-data.sh
```
Alternatively to running these two commands -which will download all four data sets- you can just download one of the data sets directly from the .py file.
To make sure the data was downloaded correctly, run

```bash
chmod +x data-check.py
```

```bash
./data-check.py
```
If you opted to download only one of the data sets you will have to edit the data-check.py file to only check for that data set.
Now to run the neural net! Using the same commands as before we will now run,

```bash
chmod +x cw-dnn.py
```

```bash
./cw-dnn.py
```
## Notes
*The numbers in the data set names refer to the standard deviation of noise within that given dataset.

*LIGO has not been able to detect continuous gravitational waves before; however, machine learning advances in neural networks like this one look promising for future directions.
